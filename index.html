          Oct. 11, 2021 <br>
          
          BY DAY, HYLOCEREUS undatus resists friendship. A climbing cactus native to Mexico and Central America but now thriving in regions 
          tropical and temperate around the world, it can grow more than 30 feet tall, colonizing trees and rock walls with extended, fleshy 
          stems, massed like the arms of an octopus. All year it sprawls, a spiked barricade — and then, one night, the flowers come. Starting 
          around dusk (depending on where in the world you are, how warm the day, the ponderousness of clouds), the pale, waxy buds, which 
          resemble elongated artichokes, start to open, the pink-tipped sepals peeling back millimeter by millimeter until, by midnight, the 
          secret is told: the blossom announcing itself, so white it seems to glow, with skinny yellow streamers at its throat. Its life is 
          a matter of hours; in the light of day, it retreats and shrivels, a ball gown turned to rags.</p>
          
          <p> A human perspective, this is parable. The American photographer Sally Mann deployed it as such in “Night Blooming Cereus,” a 1
          988 portrait of her daughter Jessie Mann, then age 7, posed with two bone white, half-wilted blossoms draped over her bare chest in 
          an ominous bodice, the child’s feral freedom already giving way to the strictures and demands of womanhood. (The term “night-blooming
           cereus” encompasses a number of species of cactuses.) Nothing lasts. The pageantry of flowering that for many plants arcs over days 
           and weeks in spring and summer — what we read as resurrection, the earth coming back to life after a hard winter — is for the night 
           bloom compressed into a single wanton evening. All that is left to greet the waking is a twist of spent petals: You missed the party.</p>
          
          <p>This is a projection of our own sense of loss, for we are not the flowers’ chosen audience. By design, night bloomers are beacons,
             their moonlight-reflecting blossoms making a theater for moths and in turn their predators, bats, who do the necessary deed of 
             collecting and scattering pollen to keep the plants alive. Nocturnal blooming is all strategy rather than poetry, purposefully 
             putting on a show while other plants sleep, when there’s less competition for pollinators. We are just the unbidden suitors, 
             cooling our heels, hoping for a glimpse of their glory. (Later, some species may bear hot pink dragon fruit with flaring green 
             edges and creamy white flesh within: a consolation prize for humans.)</p> 
          
          <p>OF COURSE, IT may be this very indifference that attracts us, makes us want to reject sleep and propriety and stay up all night 
            (when all the most interesting things happen). During the hardscrabble years of the Great Depression, people held vigils for the coming
             of the flowers, taking out notices in newspapers to proclaim that blooming in their backyards was imminent, should anyone care to sw
             ing by after nightfall. The Southern writer Eudora Welty, then in her 20s, attended such gatherings in Jackson, Miss., and even star
             ted the Night-Blooming Cereus Club, with the motto “Don’t take it cereus. Life’s too mysterious” — keeping in mind how quickly the v
             oluptuous flower dwindled into “a wrung chicken’s neck,” as one Jackson local put it.</p>
          
          <p>Often the manifestation had the quality of a miracle: In “The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America’s Great Migration” 
            (2010), the writer Isabel Wilkerson recalls how, “once a year on a midsummer night that could not be foretold,” her grandmother would
             invite neighbors over to her porch in Rome, Ga., to sip sweet tea and eat ice cream until the cereus flowers yawned wide and everyon
             e leaned in, hoping to see “the baby Jesus in the cradle in the folds.”   These days, at the Tohono Chul botanical garden in Tucson,
              Ariz., grounds staff monitor the nation’s largest private collection of Peniocereus greggii, another night-blooming cactus that is kn
              own as queen of the night, although it spends much of its life resembling nothing more than dead twigs. Once buds appear, they’re ca
              refully measured until they’re swollen enough — when they hit 120 millimeters, the countdown begins — to proclaim bloom night, when
               the public is welcomed to wander low-lit trails and spy on the flowers-to-be. (Last year, because of the pandemic, the event was s
               treamed online, and a single plant’s blooming was commemorated in a time-lapse video.)rarity and difficulty of predicting the event — of catching the flowers in the act — can make witnessing it a mark of status, 
            as in Kevin Kwan’s 2013 novel, “Crazy Rich Asians,” in which a Singaporean family of ungodly wealth amasses a crowd to pay homage to
             another night-blooming cereus species, known as tan hua in Chinese and part of the idiomatic term tan hua yi xian: “fleeting glory,”
              or “a flash in the pan.” (In China, after wilting, such flowers are dried and added to soup, and reportedly offer detoxifying bene
              fits.) But the plant, and its dinner-plate-size flower, couldn’t care less about the glamorous guests and their desire for spectacle
              ; it follows no timetable and deigns to open only at the time of its choosing. “It has its own agenda,” says the floral designer Ren
               MacDonald-Balasia of Renko, who splits her time between Honolulu and Los Angeles. “It’s nature taking its power back.” When MacDona
               ld-Balasia was growing up on Oahu, her grandmother would beckon her over just before the flowers were ready to reveal themselves: 
               “C’mon, let’s go outside.” “It was a quiet, secret thing,” says MacDonald-Balasia.</p>
           <p>
          Not all night-loving flowers have such brief lives. Some, like tuberose and gardenia, open in the day but g
          row more potent and explicit after sundown, exuding a heavy-lidded fragrance of sweetness teetering on decay. This is in part the work
           of indole, an aromatic compound present in foul-smelling substances like coal tar and feces, which in trace amounts gives the most deli
           cate of flowers an almost animal opulence. Other nocturnal blossoms deploy scents like siren calls: The creamy whorls of the moonflower v
           ine hint at vanilla and sunscreen, while the heavy bells of brugmansia are franker and muskier in aura, verging on narcotic.
            I still remember, as a teenager at college in New Jersey, the sudden loucheness of honeysuckle in the late spring dark, stopping me bar
          efoot in the wet grass. It smelled of ripeness, of knowledge and all I’d never been told. “How can I rest?” the American poet Louise Glück once wrote of a night beset by the insistent exhalations of mock orange blossoms
            <em>"How can I be content, when there is stillt, hat odor in the world? ”</em>

            <h3> The Secret Life of Plants </h3>
        <section1> <p>"The whole vegetal world, lives responsive to the movement of the earth and its satellite moon, to the movement of the other planets of our solar system”</p>
        </section1>


        <section3><p>
          The true matrix of human life is the green sward covering mother earth. Without green plants we would neither breathe nor eat. On the undersurface of every leaf a million movable lips are engaged in devouring carbon dioxide and expelling oxygen. All together, twenty-five million square miles of leaf surface are daily engaged in this miracle of photosynthesis, producing oxygen and food for man and beast.
</p>
<p>Instinctively aware of the aesthetic vibrations of plants, which are spiritually satisfying, human beings are happiest and most comfortable when living with flora. At birth, marriage, death, blossoms are prerequisites, as they are at mealtime or festivities. We give plants and flowers as tokens of love, of
  friendship, or homage, and of thanks for hospitality. Our houses are adorned with gardens, our cities with parks, our nations with national preserves. The first thing a woman does to make a room livable is to place a plant in it or a vase of fresh cut flowers. Most men, if pressed, might describe paradise, whether in heaven or on earth, as a garden filled with luxuriant orchids, uncut, frequented by a nymph or two.
  </p> <p>At the beginning of the twentieth century a gifted Viennese biologist with the Gallic name of Raoul France put forth the idea, shocking to contemporary natural philosophers, that plants move their bodies as freely, and gracefully, as the most skilled animal or human, and that the only reason we don’t appreciate the fact is that plants do so at a much slower pace than humans.

    The roots of plants, said France, burrow inquiringly into the earth, the buds and twigs swing in definite circles, the leaves and blossoms bend and shiver with change, the tendrils circle questingly and reach out with ghostly arms to feel their surroundings. Man, said France, merely thinks plants motionless and feelingless because he will not take the time to watch them. Poets and philosophers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Rudolf Steiner, who took the trouble to watch plants, discovered that they grow in opposite directions, pardy burrowing into the ground as if attracted by gravity, partly shooting up into the air as if pulled by some form of antigravity, or levity. 
    </p><p>When the earth is dry, the roots turn towards moister ground, finding their way into buried pipes, stretching, as in the case of the lowly alfalfa plant, as far as forty feet, developing an energy that can bore through concrete. No one has yet counted the roots of a tree, but a study of a single rye plant indicates a total of over thirteen million rootlets with a combined length of 380 miles. On these rootlets of a ryeplant are fine root hairs estimated to number some fourteen billion with a total length of 6,600 miles, almost the distance from pole to pole. As the special burrowing cells are worn out by contact with stones, pebbles, and large grains of sand, they are rapidly replaced, but when they reach a source of nourishment they die and are replaced by cells designed to dissolve mineral salts and collect the resulting elements. This basic nourishment is passed from cell to cell up through the plant, which constitutes a single unit of protoplasm, a watery or gelatinous substance considered the basis of physical life. The root is thus a waterpump, with water acting as a universal solvent, raising elements from root to leaf, evaporating and falling back to earth to act once more as the medium for this chain of life. The leaves of an ordinary sunflower will transpire in a day as much water as a man perspires. On a hot day a single birch can absorb as much as four hundred quarts, exuding cooling moisture through its leaves.
    </p><p>No plant, says France, is without movement, all growth is a series of movements; plants are constantly preoccupied with bending, turning and quivering. He describes a summer day with thousands of polyp-like arms reaching from a peaceful arbor, trembling, quivering in their eagerness for new support for the heavy stalk that grows behind them. Plants, says France, are capable of intent: they can stretch towards, or seek out, what they want in ways as mysterious as the most fantastic creations of romance.The whole vegetal world, says France, lives responsive to the movement of the earth and its satellite moon, to the movement of the other planets of our solar system, and one day will be shown to be affected by the stars and other cosmic bodies in the universe.

 <h3> Nutritive Soul
</h3>
        <section1> <p>Aristotle’s dogma that plants have souls but no sensations
        </p>
        </section1>
        <section3><p>"For touch is as it were a mean between all tangible qualities, and its organ is capable of receiving not only all the specific qualities which characterize earth, but also the hot and the cold and all other tangible qualities whatsoever. That is why we have no sensation by means of bones, hair, &c., because they consist of earth. So too plants, because they consist of earth, have no sensation. Without touch there can be no other sense, and the organ of touch cannot consist of earth or of any other single element,”

          </p>
          <p>“The several parts of the soul are indisseverable from one another, although the whole soul is divisible. It seems also that the principle found in plants is also a kind of soul; for this is the only principle which is common to both animals and plants; and this exists in isolation from the principle of sensation, though there nothing which has the latter without the former… the soul is the first grade of actuality of a natural body having life potentially in it. The body so described is a body which is organized. The parts of plants in spite of their extreme simplicity are ‘organs’; e.g. the leaf serves to shelter the pericarp, the pericarp to shelter the fruit, while the roots of plants are analogous to the mouth of animals, both serving for the absorption of food… Living, that is, may mean thinking or perception or local movement and rest, or movement in the sense of nutrition, decay and growth. Hence we think of plants also as living, for they are observed to possess in themselves an originative power through which they increase or decrease in all spatial directions; they grow up and down, and everything that grows increases its bulk alike in both directions or indeed in all, and continues to live so long as it can absorb nutriment. This power of self-nutrition can be isolated from the other powers mentioned, but not they from it-in mortal beings at least. The fact is obvious in plants; for it is the only psychic power they possess.” </p>
  <p>"Empedocles is wrong in adding that growth in plants is to be explained, the downward rooting by the natural tendency of earth to travel downwards, and the upward branching by the similar natural tendency of fire to travel upwards. For he misinterprets up and down; up and down are not for all things what they are for the whole Cosmos: if we are to distinguish and identify organs according to their functions, the roots of plants are analogous to the head in animals. Further, we must ask what is the force that holds together the earth and the fire which tend to travel in contrary directions; if there is no counteracting force, they will be torn asunder; if there is, this must be the soul and the cause of nutrition and growth. By some the element of fire is held to be the cause of nutrition and growth, for it alone of the primary bodies or elements is observed to feed and increase itself. Hence the suggestion that in both plants and animals it is it which is the operative force. A concurrent cause in a sense it certainly is, but not the principal cause, that is rather the soul; for while the growth of fire goes on without limit so long as there is a supply of fuel, in the case of all complex wholes formed in the course of nature there is a limit or ratio which determines their size and increase, and limit and ratio are marks of soul but not of fire, and belong to the side of formulable essence rather than that of matter.”

  <h2><em>THE BIOPHILIA HYPOTHESIS</em></h2>
        <br>
        <h3> The Development of Biophilia</h3>
        <section1><p>Love of life (biophilia) in philosophy, psychology, and evolution</p></section1>
  <section4><p>
    The tendency of humans to have belongingness with nature and different life forms is the main basis of the biophilia hypothesis. It has been evident since the appearance of the first humans on this planet and hence has been a noticeable trait since ancient times. Aristotle was one of the many people who put forward a concept that was summarized as “love of life”. With the use of the word philia (i.e. love) Aristotle emphasizes the relationship between humans and nature and highlights the idea of reciprocity of similar drive that is exhibited between humans and different organisms culminating into friendships that are beneficial to both parties. He clearly states that out of the many benefits received by both humans and the other life-forms the most significant is the way of happiness that it provides especially for humans.
    </p><p>Over the years this concept has been stated and notified and established in one form or another. The biophilia hypothesis definition was first given by Erich Fromm when he used the term “Biophilia”, meaning an innate affinity of life or living organisms while describing a psychological orientation that causes an intense attraction towards all that is alive and vital. The idea of biophilia was introduced as a concept and hypothesis in the book Biophilia by biologist Edward O. Wilson. According to the biophilia hypothesis definition given by him, the hypothesis is a concept of Biophilia which is “the urge to affiliate with other forms of life”. In the book, Wilson also says that biophilia is a description of “the connections that human beings subconsciously seek with the rest of life”. More quotes below:
    </p><p>“I have argued in this book that we are human in good part because of the particular way we affiliate with other organisms. They are the matrix in which the human mind originated and is permanently rooted, and they offer the challenge and freedom innately sought”. 
"If natural diversity is the wellspring of human intelligence, then the systematic destruction inherent in contemporary technology and economics is
 a war against the very sources of mind . . . It is impossible to unravel natural diversity without undermining human intelligence as well”. 
      Peter Kahn and Stephen Kellert have stated in their book, Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural and Evolutionary Investigat
      ions have emphasized the importance of animals in the development of nurturing relationships especially with the kids during early and middle
       childhood. The book also reports the help that children affected with autistic-spectrum disorders gain with their relationships to animals, th
       us showing results in favour of the biophilia hypothesis. In the book, The Biophilia Hypothesis, edited by Stephen Kellert And Edward Wilson an
       d Lynn Margulis, the hypothesis is further developed as part of the theories in the field of evolutionary psychology. Weaving scientific findings t
       ogether with personal experiences and perspectives. Kellert explores how our humanity in the most fundamental sense—including our physical health, 
       and capacities for affection, aversion, intellect, control, aesthetics, exploitation, spirituality, and communication are deeply contingent on the q
       uality of our connections to the natural world. But, like much of what it means to be human, this inborn tendency must be learned to become fully fun
       ctional. Also, the work of Stephen Kellert attempts to determine and define the common human responses to the perceptions of and about plants, animals
       , and to explain to them the terms and conditions of human evolution.</p></section4>
       <h3>  In Context of Biological Evolution
      </h3>  <section1><p>The deep affiliation human have with other life forms and nature as a whole are rotted in our biology</p></section1><section4><p>The psychological responses that are generated within humans with respect to n
        ature and different life-forms have been known and clear since the arrival of the first homo species. 
        The connections or the love described in the biophilia hypothesis definition are not only the responses of 
        attraction or moving towards but also the responses of fear or moving away from certain life-forms. For example, 
        since olden times, humans have been attracted to particular flowers and fruits as they have lived very closely with 
        nature in the past and that attraction continues even today. This is because these flowers and fruits are a source of 
        diversity and nutrition respectively and provide feelings of satisfaction, psychologically speaking. On the other hand, humans 
        have been afraid of snakes and arachnids such as spiders, which is a phobic response to life-forms since they have been dangerous 
        to human beings in the past and the response is still significantly visible in the population. So, both positive and negative 
        affiliations towards nature and natural objects such as species and natural phenomena, as compared to artificial ones, 
        have been evidence of biophilia. This is visible by the practices of keeping plants and flowers in and around the homes and keeping animals as pets.</p><p>Although these responses and preferences have been refined through different experiences and culture leading to the present state, hypothetically they are products of biological evolution. And this is not limited to only humans but can be found commonly in all living organisms. The best example of such a relationship between biophilia and biological evolution is the attraction that adult mammals have to baby mammal faces as they are found to be appealing across species. The large eyes and small features of any young mammal face are found to be more appealing than adult features and are a common aspect of any species. This hypothesis explains why ordinary people show care and a protective attitude towards domestic and wild animals even to the extent of risking their lives. 
          Thus, our love for life helps sustain life. </p></section4>


          <h2><em>EXPERIENCES IN NATURE, EXISTENTIAL ANXIETIES, and WELL BEINGS </em></h2>
        <h3> Eco-Existential Positive Psychology: </h3>
        <section1><p>Numerous scholars have explored the notion that our relationship with nature is essential to our well-being, and some have suggested that we have an evolved inclination to affiliate with nature. A substantial body of research supports these hypotheses, demonstrates both the restorative and additive capacity of affiliating with nature.
</p></section1> <br><section5><p>Increased time spent indoors using technology—on average Canadians spend almost 90% of their time indoors (Environment Canada, 2007)—necessarily means that we are also losing our connection with the natural world (Glendinning, 1994). If this disturbing trend of humankind’s increased distancing from direct experiences in nature continues, the well-being of the planet’s ecosystem will continue to degrade. It may also be supposed that existential angst among people will thereby continue to increase. For underlying all the facets of existential anxiety discussed herein is the most primordial existential anxiety of all—an anxiety not regarding ‘‘who am I as an isolated, individual human seeking happiness, meaning, and freedom?’’, but rather, an existential anxiety regarding ‘‘who am I am as a human in a larger natural world?’’ (see Adams, 2006).

    Wong’s (2009) amalgamation of Existential Psychology and Positive Psychology—what he
    titled Existential Positive Psychology—is concerned with ‘‘the study of ultimate concerns
    through integrating both positive and negative aspects of the human condition to create a better future for self and others’’ (p. 362). Existential Positive Psychology merges Existential
    Psychology’s focus on the darker realities of human existence such as meaninglessness,
    alienation, and death and its phenomenological analysis, with Positive Psychology’s brighter
    focus on human strengths and well-being and its emphasis on scientific methodologies. It proposes an expanded vision of Positive Psychology, one that recognizes that addressing all
    six types of existential anxieties is necessary for human flourishing.
    
    Specifically, Wong’s (2009) Existential Positive Psychology stresses the importance of an
    authentic self-identity. Three types of mature happiness are endorsed: (a) authentic happiness,
    that arises from being an authentic person, (b) eudaimonic happiness, which ‘‘comes from doing virtuous deeds’’ (p. 364), and (c) chaironic happiness, connected with our spiritual nature. A major focus of Existential Positive Psychology concerns the quest for meaning and purpose. The human need for relationships and community is another important aspect of Existential Positive Psychology, as is the need to address freedom anxiety whilst not neglecting the quest for responsibility. Last, Existential Positive Psychology squarely faces the issue of death, and suggests that ‘‘how we react to death will impact how we live . . . and this link represents the last frontier of Positive Psychology. . . . we can use our capacity for meaning, spirituality and narrative construction to transform death anxiety’’ (pp. 367–368). Given psychology’s increasing interest in the multifaceted relationship between humans and the greater natural environment (e.g., Kidner, 2007; Milton, 2010; Reser, 2007), this article utilizes Wong’s (2009) Existential Positive Psychology as a framework from which to address existential anxieties from an ‘‘eco’’ perspective.
    </p>
    <p><em>Identity</em><br>
      Man in his historical infancy . . . remains rooted in nature . . . in relating himself to [elements of nature], the individual finds his sense of identity and belonging. (Fromm, 1956, pp. 48–49)
      
      Authenticity is an integral focus of existential and humanistic literature. Buber wrote of the
      importance of the natural world in the relational I-Thou experience, an experience that enhances the authenticity of the self (or I) and the well-being of the other or Thou (Buber, 1923=1958). Moustakas (1985) regarded ‘‘an authentic relationship to [one’s] self, to other human beings, to nature, and the universe’’ as necessary to being fully human (p. 5). Eco-Existential Positive Psychology specifically incorporates the natural nonhuman environment into the search for self-identity. An expanded sense of self-identity that incorporates the natural world could help to reconcile people with the essence of who they are as human beings and with their unique place in the larger scheme of things, thus, resulting in a sense of authenticity. Experiences of authenticity have recently been linked with transcending the self in a direction toward harmony or interconnectedness between the self and the natural environment (Dambrun & Ricard, 2011). A number of writers have expounded upon the essential role that the natural nonhuman world plays in forming our self-concept. For example, Shepard (1996) outlined how we have a long history of comparing ourselves to other animal species to define who we uniquely are as humans. Kalof (2003) also argued that ‘‘human identity is developed through relationships with nonhuman others . . . whether the discourse is framed by similarity, difference, or blurred boundaries’’ (p. 161). In his review of psychological research concerning children and animals, Foulkes (1999) outlined how this comparison and identification with animals occurs early in childhood. In the stories of preschool children, characters are predominantly animals, with the child identifying with the animal to the extent that the animal becomes the child at some point in the story.  Animals are often present in young children’s dreams, wherein the animals have human concerns and are often the objects of identification. In fact, 61% of the dream content of children between the ages of 3 and 5 is composed of animals, despite children having vastly more interactions with humans (Foulkes, 1982). As a child’s sense of self develops, the predominance of animal compared to human characters decreases, particularly between the ages of 7 to 9. Animal dreaming does, however, remain evident at later ages.
      
      As adults, our language is peppered with references to the nonhuman animal world in regards
      to self- and other- identities and action: for example, ‘‘he’s a busy beaver;’’ ‘‘she’s a wise old
      owl.’’ This adult identification with animals goes beyond mere verbal comparisons. In his
      review of sociological ideologies and research concerning animals’ role in key processes that shape self and society, Myers (2003) specifically argued that the idea of self takes root within
      a context of a mixed species community. He provides several examples of how individuals’
      selves can be deeply shaped by relationships with other species. For instance, in a study concerning how self-identity can be jointly anchored in human society and in a nonhuman animate relationship, Myers and Russel (2003) conducted in-depth interviews with individuals regarding their encounters=relationships with wild Black bears. Their qualitative analysis revealed that individuals who had early, repeated, or vivid experiences with wild bears, had an expanded circle of identity that included the natural world and other animals.
      In addition to animals, other elements of the natural world also help to shape our individual,
      and collective, identity. For example, Sommer (2003) reviewed how trees figure prominently in
      many theoretical perspectives of identity: many cultural myths describe how people were created from trees or transformed into trees; depth psychology utilizes trees in personality tests (such as the house-tree-person drawing test) to investigate identity issues; phenomenological approaches rely on tree metaphors of roots, trunks, and canopy.
      Recognizing this innate and diverse tendency for identification with the natural world, Leary,
      Tipsord, and Tate (2008) proposed that an important category of self-construal is that of selfidentification with both the social (i.e., human) and natural (i.e., nonhuman) worlds. To test the extent to which people include other entities into their self-concept, Leary and colleagues developed the Allo-Inclusive Identity Scale, which measures the degree to which individuals incorporate other people and the nonhuman world into their sense of self. Empirical research has shown a positive, significant relationship between the degree to which an individual incorporates nature into their identity and various indices of well-being (Howell, Dopko, Passmore, & Buro, 2011; Zelenski & Nisbet, 2012; see also the Metapersonal Self Scale; DeCicco & Stroink, 2007). Moreover, in Zelenski and Nisbet’s study, this relationship remained significant even when controlling for general connectedness (to family, friends, community), thus suggesting that including nature in one’s self-identity contributes to well-being in a distinct manner (see also Happiness section the follows). The significance of the natural landscape to identity has been addressed by several writers and researchers. Taylor (2007) wrote of how attachment to landscape helps to fulfill our deepest need for a sense of identity. Corroborating this statement is research by Cobb (1977), Sebba (1991), and Chawla (2002), each of whom reported that many adults in their respective studies reported childhood experiences with natural outdoor settings as their most significant memories; moreover, these adults credited these experiences with being significant sources of aspects of their adult personality. Singer (1981) argued that morality reflects the expansion of one’s circle of concern toward all humans and other sentient beings, and possibly toward living and nonliving natural objects such as mountains, plants, and streams.
      </p><p><em>Happiness</em><br>[As] psychologists we have heard but little about gardens, about foliage, about forests and farmland. . . Perhaps this resource for enhancing health, happiness, and wholeness has been neglected long enough. (Kaplan & Kaplan, 1989, p. 189)

        Experiences in nature can result in a direct increase of various forms of happiness or well-being (e.g., eudaimonic and hedonic well-being, chaironic or spiritual well-being), in addition to increasing well-being via satisfaction of basic psychological needs (e.g., competence, relatedness, autonomy).
        
        Eudaimonic well-being. Commensurate with the development of reliable and valid measures
        of nature connectedness, the last decade has seen an increase in both correlational and
        experimental research linking nature connectedness with well-being. Several correlational studies have assessed the association between individual differences in nature connectedness and aspects of well-being, and a growing body of research is demonstrating a reliable positive correlation between nature connectedness and aspects of eudaimonic well-being such as psychological and social well-being, personal growth, engagement, and meaning (Herzog & Strevey, 2008; Howell et al., 2011; Howell, Passmore, & Buro, 2013; Nisbet, Zelenski, & Murphy, 2011; Peterson, Ruch, Beerman, Park, & Seligman, 2007). Hinds and Sparks (2011) measured eudaemonia as a composite of serenity, a sense of awe, contemplation, empathy, aliveness, a sense of freedom, connectedness, and feeling refreshed. They reported a ‘‘notable tendency for . . . more more natural or wild environments . . . to be associated with higher levels of eudaimonia’’ (p. 462). Of particular interest is their additional finding that some natural environments (such as mountains, forests, and woodlands) elicited high levels of both eudaemonia and loneliness, isolation, and anxiety pertaining to apprehension. As we discuss further on, there are both positive and negative experiences in nature; however, Hinds and Sparks suggest that ‘‘being lonely, isolated and anxious’’ in natural environments appears to be experienced positively (p. 463).
        
        Hedonic well-being. Although often maligned as being of lesser quality than, or even opposed to, eudaimonic well-being, Huta and Ryan (2010) put forth that these types of happiness ‘‘occupy overlapping and distinct niches within a complete picture of well-being, and their combination may be associated with the greatest well-being’’ (p. 735). In general, correlational studies have shown an inconsistent correlation between nature connectedness and hedonic well-being as measured by emotional well-being, life satisfaction, and positive affect (e.g. Diessner, Solom, Frost, Parsons, & Davidson, 2008; Howell et al., 2011; Mayer & Frantz, 2004). It is possible that nature connectedness relates to some aspects of hedonic functioning, such as vitality, more than others. Germane to this suggestion is Huta and Ryan’s finding that vitality appears to be related equally to both eudaimonic and hedonic pursuits. In this vein, vitality has been demonstrated to increase after connecting with nature: In a series of studies, Ryan and colleagues (2010) found that, regardless of the influence of social, physical, and outdoor activity, behaviors involving nature predicted greater vitality. Nisbet and colleagues (2011) demonstrated how the cognitive aspect of relating to nature also has a vitalizing effect. In this study, students in courses pertaining to the environment reported higher levels of vitality than did students in other courses; this higher level of vitality was accounted for by environmental studies students maintaining a stronger sense of connectedness to nature (compared to other students) during a time period of stressful school exams and weather that was less amenable to outdoor activity.
        
        Chaironic well-being. Validated measures of spiritual well-being and spirituality commonly
        include items relating to nature; examples include Gomez and Fisher’s (2003) Spiritual
        Well-Being Questionnaire (e.g., items pertaining to ‘‘developing connection with nature’’ and ‘‘developing oneness with nature’’), Underwood and Teresi’s (2002) Daily Spiritual Experience
        Scale (e.g., ‘‘I am spiritually touched by the beauty of creation’’), and Delaney’s (2005) Spirituality Scale (e.g., ‘‘I believe that nature should be respected’’). Several studies provide empirical support for a close relationship between spirituality and nature connectedness. Leary and colleagues (2008) reported a significant, positive correlation between the level to which an individual incorporates nature into their self-identity and their level of spirituality. Diessner and colleagues’ (2008) research on appreciating beauty evidenced significant associations between nature and spirituality. Saraglou, Buxant, and Tilquin (2008) assessed spirituality as a function of nature immersion. Students randomly assigned to watch a video clip of either childbirth or nature scored higher on a measure of spirituality than did those assigned to watch a video clip of either humour or one of neutral content. (See also Terhaar, 2009, for a literature review of empirical findings demonstrating that exposure to nature often triggers intense spiritual experiences.) 
        
        The intertwining of spirituality and nature appears to be true even for those individuals who
        stringently reject a spiritual belief system involving a deity. Caldwell-Harris, Wilson, LoTempo,
        and Beit-Hallahmi (2008) found that atheists agreed with statements that measured aspects of
        spirituality construed as respect for nature to the same extent as did Catholics and Buddhists. Furthermore, approximately one-third of the atheists endorsed the term spirituality in relation to an appreciation of nature, and nature was the most frequently cited source of wonderment. It may be that ‘‘biophilia may be difficult to tease apart from what some people call a relationship with ‘spirit’ or ‘God’’ (Soule, 1993, p. 444).
        
        Well-being through meeting basic psychological needs. It is also possible that the relationship between nature affiliation and well-being is mediated by the extent to which basic psychological needs are met through contact with nature (see also Clayton, 2003). Kellert (1997) speculated that involvement with nature may satisfy needs similar to those of competence, relatedness, and autonomy; these are the very needs underscored in self-determination theory (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 2000).
        
        Regarding competency needs, outdoor educational and therapy programs capitalize on the
        unlimited opportunities nature provides for individuals to demonstrate personal competencies
        through activities such as wilderness camping adventures (Newes & Bandoroff, 2004). Urban nature experiences also lend themselves to helping fulfill individual’s competency needs through activities such as outdoor or container gardening (Hunter, 2006). Competency as a result of learning about the world in general is readily fostered by nature experiences. Interacting with nature also contributes indirectly to fulfilling our competency needs, in that the feelings of vitality nature inspires in us (see Nisbet et al., 2011; Ryan et al., 2010) spill over into other areas of our lives, prompting us to ‘‘roll up our sleeves,’’ tackle new projects, and therefore to experience expanded opportunities for accomplishment. Relationships between the natural environment and needs of relatedness and autonomy are discussed further in this article in the Isolation and Freedom sections, respectively.
        </p><p><em>Meaning in Life
        </em><br>Meaning in life stems, in part, from an individual’s identification with elements of stable
        patterns and permanency within a changing world (Baumeister, 1991), beliefs that life fits within
        a larger scheme (Wong, 2010), and an individual’s ability for self-transcendence (Emmons,
        2005; Frankl, 1959=1984; Steger, 2009; Wong, 1998). Theoretically, it has been suggested that
        these key elements of meaning in life can be found in nature.
        
        Numerous literary references refer to the patterns that are discernible in nature that express
        deep order and of the comfort to be found in the order and permanence of nature (Camus,
        1955; McKibben, 1989; Vernon, 2008). For example, although societal norms, architectural
        styles, and the latest fad in synthetically manufactured objects come and go, nature persists.
        Perennial plants and trees that seemingly die every winter, blossom anew each spring. The tides of the oceans ebb and flow today, as they have for millennia. Numerous literary references can be found that refer to the connection between the natural world and meaning or purpose in life. Many of Admiral Bird’s diary entries from his winter Antarctic expedition speak to the power that the natural environment had in awakening a sense of purpose in his life: ‘‘Here were imponderable processes and forces of the cosmos, harmonious and soundless. . . . The conviction came that . . . there must be a purpose in the whole and that man was part of the whole and not an accidental off-shoot’’ (Byrd, 1938=2003, p. 85). Several writers and researchers have also referred to the perspective-making power of nature. 
        
        Kaplan and Kaplan’s (1989) assertion that the deepest instances of nature involvement elicit ‘’reflection on one’s life, on one’s priorities and possibilities, on one’s actions and one’s goals’’ (p. 197) was echoed by Kalnin (2008), who wrote that ‘‘there are times when the beauty and tranquility of [natural] places allow us to see the world and our part in it from a completely different perspective’’ (p. 15). Cohen, Gruber, and Keltner (2010) argued that awe experiences, which are often elicited by natural beauty, have the central feature of ‘‘the demand to find new meaning’’ (p. 128) and that ‘‘[n]atural beauty . . . gives people a sense of understanding and perspective’’ (p. 128). A sense of meaning can be created through the development of a coherent life narrative (McAdams, 1993), and by integrating personal events of an individual’s life story ‘‘into a larger, overarching meaning system’’ (Steger, 2009, p. 682). Consistent with this view, Berger and McLeod (2006) have advised that the use of nature analogies and embedding clients’ experiences ‘‘in a larger story of natural life’’ (p. 91) can help clients bestow and extract meaning to guide them through change.
        
        Baumeister and Vohs (2002) put forth that ‘‘the essence of meaning is connection’’ (p. 608);
        various forms of connection—including a connection to nature—have been surmised to provide coherence and meaning in life. Heine, Proulx, and Vohs (2006) emphasized that meaning is found in connecting the self to the external world; consistent with this idea, Haybron (2011) suggested that nature experiences may yield meaning by their provision of ‘‘engagement with matters of independent worth’’ (p. 238). Note (2009) also made reference to the meaningfulness that can be derived from our sense of experiencing nature as an external reality with which we form an ethical, reciprocal relationship that involves transcending our immediate spatial reference. Several authors (Frankl, 1959=1984; Kellert, 2002; Reker; 1996; Verbeek & de Waal, 2002) have put forth that experiencing the natural world, or cultivating one’s connection and relationship with nature, can be an important aspect of meaning in life. Buber (1923=1958), too, suggested that meaning can be found through a relationship with nature; specifically, Buber posited that meaningfulness is found through the relational spheres of ‘‘our life with nature, . . . our life with men, . . . [and] our life with spiritual beings’’ (p. 98). Importantly, Butler (2006) proposed that a connection with nature is related to our search for both meaning and happiness. Empirical findings provide support for the association between nature affiliation and meaning in life. In studies examining sources of meaning, experiences in natural environments have emerged as a significant category for adults in mid-life (O’Connor & Chamberlain, 1996) and older adults (Reker & Woo, 2011), and Nisbet and colleagues (2011) showed that purpose in life was a significant correlate of nature affiliation.
        
        Wong (2009) reported that two major sources of meaning are self-transcendence and religion.
        Empirical studies have linked these two constructs with nature. Keltner and Haidt (2003) include nature among the most common elicitors of awe, an emotion they describe as ‘‘central to the experience of religion’’ (p. 297); Shiota, Keltner, and Mossman (2007) reported that participants instructed to think of time spent in a natural setting reported feeling the presence of something greater than themselves. Howell and colleagues (2013) explored the interrelationship between nature connectedness, well-being, and meaning in life. In two studies, Howell and colleagues tested the hypothesis that meaning in life would mediate the association between nature connectedness and well-being. Multiple self-report measures of nature connectedness, meaning in life, and well-being were utilized.
        
        Significant, positive correlations emerged between nature connectedness and meaning in
        life, between nature connectedness and well-being, and between meaning in life and well-being. Mediational analyses supported the hypothesis that meaning in life fully mediates the association between nature connectedness and well-being.
      </p><p><em>Isolation</em><br>Our sense of nature relatedness helps to assuage man’s existential loneliness in the Universe.
        (Searles, 1960, p. 122)
        
        Nelson (1993) suggested that isolation from the natural community has created for us a ‘‘profound and imperiling loneliness’’ (p. 221). Experiences with nature afford us a greater sense
        of relatedness and social connectedness. Clayton (2003) suggested that ‘‘relatedness comes from the opportunity to feel like a part of a functioning system’’ and that redefining oneself in a way that includes the natural environment can reduce the sense of isolation and separateness that many people feel (p. 50). Schwartz (1994) defined the value of universalism as involving both connection with all of humanity and with the natural world. Mayer, Frantz, Bruehlman-Senecal, and Dolliver (2009) suggested that ‘‘when practitioners think of how to create settings to help clients feel better, they may want to . . . think of how people need to feel a sense of belonging to something larger than themselves and that this need may be fulfilled through a sense of belonging or connectedness to the natural world’’ (p. 635).
        
        Lending empirical credence to these notions, Terhaar (2009) showed that when immersed in a
        natural environment, an ‘‘individual’s sense of separateness of self dissolves’’ and individuals
        report feeling more connected (p. 312); and Shiota and colleagues (2007) reported that
        participants asked to think of a recent time when they were in a natural setting gave higher
        ratings to such statements as ‘‘I felt connected with the world around me,’’ compared to participants asked to think of a recent time when they felt pride. In multiple studies utilizing multiple measures, social well-being has been show to correlate significantly with nature affiliation (Howell et al., 2011; Howell et al., 2013).
        
        Experimental studies have shown that exposure to nature can increase generous behavior
        toward others, increased endorsement of intrinsic goals such as closeness and community,
        and a decreased endorsement of extrinsic goals such as personal fame and fortune. For example, Weinstein, Przybylski, and Ryan (2009) reported all three of these effects in a series of four experiments that exposed participants to nature via either photographs depicting nature scenes or a 5-min rest period in a plant laden laboratory (control conditions were photographs of built environments or a 5-min rest period in a plant-free laboratory). Several researchers (Kuo, 2003; Kuo, Sullivan, Coley, & Brunson, 1998; Sommer, 2003; Sullivan, Kuo, & Depooter, 2004) have reported that the amount of green space in neighborhoods is positively correlated with the strength of social ties reported among neighbors, the amount of concern neighbors expressed with helping and supporting each other, and with the amount of prosocial activity in the neighborhood. Sommer (2003) presented a variety of evidence from several studies demonstrating how, in particular, volunteer tree planting programs in urban areas enhanced social connectedness among neighbors, in addition to enhancing the local natural environment. 
        Further research along this line is provided by Hine and colleagues (2007), who reported that volunteers for a conservatio
        n group listed the benefits of their service as including not only positive feelings about helping the environment and enhanced
         understanding of conservation issues, but also ‘‘social capital benefits’’ such as meeting new people and being part of a ‘‘coming together of people for a good cause’
         ’ (pp. 6–7).Even within built environments, brief exposure to natural elements has been shown to be conducive to
         improving social connections. For example, Ruso and Atzwanger (2003) conducted naturalistic observations of people in a shopping mall corridor where they had installe
          a water fountain. They reported that when the fountain was filled with water (compared to when the fountain was empty), people were more likely to interact with each 
          other. Our bonds with animals, particularly our pets, also help to reduce feelings of isolation and fulfill our social relatedness needs. Epley, Akalis, Waytz, and Ca
          cioppo (2008) showed that, under conditions of social isolation, people anthropomorphize nonhuman animals as a means of buffering the threat of being alone. In an edit
          d book by Podberscek, Paul, and Serpell (2000), numerous authors explored evidence of how animals can be highly significant social companions to people of all ages in a 
          erse array of cultures and countries (see also Smolkovic, Fajfar, & Mlinaric, 2012, for a literature summary). In a study of 339 adults, Wood, Giles-Corti, and Bulsara (200
          5) reported that significantly fewer pet owners reported feeling lonely compared to non-pet-owners. A variety of studies have reported that pet ownership is positively asso
          ciated with social contact, and that pets often act as robust facilitators of social interaction. McNicholas and Collis (2000) demonstrated that the frequency of social inte
          ions, especially interactions with strangers, significantly increased when people were accompanied by a dog when out walking. Wood and colleagues (2005) reported that 50% of 
          dog owners reported that they got to know their neighbors because of their dog, and significantly more pet owners than non-pet-owners viewed others as sociable and helpful.
           Other studies have found that pets promoted social interactions within a long-stay psychiatric population (Hall & Malpus, 2000), service dogs significantly increased the amount
            of social interaction between people in wheelchairs and passersby (Eddy, Hart, & Boltz, 1988), and older adults with dementia who participated in a 3-week Animal-Assisted 
            Therapy program displayed a significant increase in social interactions post-therapy (Richeson, 2003).</p><p><em>Freedom</em><br>The sound of the brook hitting the rock, The whisper of the wind in my ear, The sound of the bird
              who just woke up, And I know that my freedom is here. (Walker, 2008)
              
              For a period of 2 years before 15-year-old Anne Frank was captured and put to death in a
              Nazi concentration camp, her diary-writings were filled with references to the beauty and
              freedom of a chestnut tree that she could glimpse through the window of her secret hiding place.
              
              In 2007, a successful global campaign was launched to save ‘‘the Anne Frank tree’’ after it was
              marked for felling by officials who feared it would fall over in a storm. Campaigners, many of
              whom were neighbors of where the tree was growing, argued that, as a symbol of freedom, the
              tree was worth making extraordinary efforts to preserve (‘‘Work begins,’’ 2008).
              Nature—particularly wild nature—has long been associated with spontaneity, self-organizing
              processes, and freedom (for reviews see Norton, 1986; Ridder, 2005; Sessions, 1992). Drew (1999) describes how illustrations of the powerful symbolic significance of what Ridder has deemed ‘‘nature-inspired-autonomy’’ can be found in anti-utopian literature (i.e., Zamyatin’s [1983] We, Huxley’s [1931=1968] Brave New World, Orwell’s [1949=1954] 1984). These fictional, yet somewhat prescient, works depict future modern societies as repressive, technological, totalitarian regimes that stifle expressions of individual creativity and choice. Within these works, nature is portrayed as inspiring downtrodden citizens to seek out and express their individualism and personal freedom.
              
              Nature-inspired autonomy also holds true as a powerful force in reality. Many people today
              struggle with the values and pressures imposed on them by society; although ‘‘the complexity
              and interdependence of contemporary life often thwarts the realization of personal distinctiveness, the natural world continues to afford opportunities for people to achieve feelings of autonomy and individuality’’ (Kellert, 1997, p. 130). The natural environment enhances perceived autonomy because ‘‘there are fewer commands or requests from others that limit behavioral choices’’ (Clayton, 2003, p. 50). Nature does not impose on us expectations of arbitrary social propriety; we are free simply to be.
              
              Empirical research supports this position. Fredrickson and Anderson (1999) reported that
              for many of the women they interviewed ‘‘what made their wilderness experience especially
              meaningful was the fact that there was virtually no reason to be anyone but themselves’’
              (p. 30). Furthermore, experimental studies have demonstrated that exposure to nature can bolster an individual’s sense of freedom to be who they truly are and to act without pretense. Mayer and colleagues (2009) conducted a series of studies that compared reactions of participants exposed to nature (via a walk in a natural environment or viewing a videotape of the same nature walk) to reactions of participants exposed to urban settings (via a walk in an urban area or viewing a videotape of the same urban walk). Significantly reduced public self-awareness was reported by participants in the nature conditions (particularly in the actual as opposed to virtual nature conditions). Mayer and colleagues speculated that, in essence, individuals exposed to nature felt an increased sense of freedom to report how they truly felt relative to individuals exposed to urban scenarios. Experimental evidence has also emerged that links exposure to nature with increased autonomy; that is, in studies conducted by Weinstein and colleagues (2009), the more participants were immersed in nature contexts, the more autonomous they felt. Augmenting these findings is qualitative research from Hammitt (1982), who found that what wilderness users were seeking was, in part, ‘‘the freedom of choice in selecting with whom, when, and to what extent they must interact’’ (p. 482), choices not found in the complex social environments prevalent in modern urban cities.
              
              Yalom (1980) wrote that ‘‘In the existential sense, ‘freedom’ refers to the absence of external
              structure . . . [where] the individual is entirely responsible for . . . his or her own world, life,
              design, choices and actions’’ (p. 8). Wong (2009) stressed that Existential Positive Psychology
              ‘‘is concerned with how to strike a healthy balance between freedom and responsibility’’
              (p. 367).We propose that natural environments appear to provide a foundational setting for this
              balance to occur. This is due, in part, to the fact that the link between behavior and its consequences are apparent in an immediate and fundamental way in a natural setting (Scherl,
              1989). For example, if we are cold when outside, it is up to us to take steps to warm ourselves
              via starting a fire or donning extra layers of clothes. Dramatic illustrations of this can be found in nature adventure literature. A common theme in this literature is that these seekers of freedom, personal expression, and adventure do not entertain illusions of nature as a beneficent mother; rather these responders to the call of the wild understand that their journey will also entail peril, adversity, and great challenges (Krakauer, 1996; I. Wilson & Wilson, 1987). Positive development oftentimes requires overcoming adversity; this may be paralleled in
              humans’ positive and negative experiences of nature (as referred to earlier). The necessity of
              nature appreciation at times arises directly from the raw, elemental facets of nature that evoke
              intense feelings of awe at the power of nature (Cohen et al., 2010; Keltner & Haidt, 2003; Shiota
              et al., 2007). Keltner and Haidt proposed that experiences of awe are both ‘‘profoundly positive
              and terrifyingly negative’’ (p. 303). This can, for example, include nature-induced experiences
              of awe wherein one feels completely connected to, and at one with, the vastness of the universe; concurrently experiencing a sense of diminished self, recognizing the insignificance and smallness of one’s individual self within this vastness. Among the well-known writings of
              Wordsworth and Thoreau extolling the sublime virtues of nature, one can also find stark
              passages vividly depicting this ‘‘terrible awe’’ that fill a person when confronting the ‘‘divine’’
              power of nature (Cronon, 1995, p. 74–75).
              
              The raw, elemental, and dynamic push-pull of joy-fear, tranquility-aliveness, isolation connectedness, danger-freedom that nature experiences afford us is perhaps one reason that we are innately drawn to nature. Cronon (1995) provided several illustrations of this dualistic characteristic of nature. In one such example, Cronon described how, historically, the wilderness represented not only a place full of devils and spiritual temptation, but also the setting in which one was most likely to encounter God. Elsewhere, Cronon described how the unexplored American frontier represented ‘‘a last bastion of rugged individualism,’’ autonomy and freedom, ‘‘where an individual could escape the confining structures of civilized life;’’ yet this frontier landscape simultaneously fostered the banding together of these rugged individuals ‘‘with their neighbors to form communities’’ (p. 77). The duality of nature as symbolizing both freedom and danger was also alluded to by Drew (1999) in reference to the anti-utopian literature described previously. Nature, in these works, inspires people not only to ‘‘negate what subjugates . . . them as individuals’’ but also to ‘‘claim the right to God, . . . to real danger, [and] to freedom’’ (p. 77).
              </p><p><em>Death</em><br>Thous know’st ‘tis common, all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity. (Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 2) From a Jungian perspective on ecopsychology, Pienaar (2011) argued that nature, serving as a
              symbolic representation of time, serves to increase our existential awareness of our own mortality, that we experience nature as a continuity of the self, and that the human psyche is coextensive with nature. ‘‘As such, it is a general tendency, for example, to associate a tree with life and transformations’’ (Pienaar, 2011, p. 26). Frankl (1959=1984) provides us with a poignant example of this in his description of the solace one woman in a Nazi concentration death-camp gained from the view of a single branch of a chestnut tree on which there were two blossoms: ‘’It said to her, ‘I am here—I am here—I am life, eternal life’ ’’ (p. 78).
              
              Ernest Becker (1973) proposed that individuals transmute and transcend the ‘‘terror’’ (p. 15) of
              death by maintaining a ‘‘belief in immortality, the extension of one’s being into eternity’’ (p. 24).
              Connecting with nature embeds us more deeply into the existence of life beyond the course of our single lifetime (Berger, 1980). There is a ‘‘universal truth inherent in the cycles of nature that can connect people to the larger cycle we are all part of’’ (Berger & McLeod, 2006, p. 86–87).
              Although the natural rhythms of the Earth as it passes from day to night, and season to season,
              provide a daily reminder of our own mortality and the transitory nature of our own beings, we
              are also reminded of the ‘‘cyclical relationships between life and death, nourishment and deprival’’ and how ‘‘such a relationship is in fact a necessary condition for the functioning of
              the Earth’’ (Pienaar, 2011, p. 27). We accept that, not only is death inevitable, but that death
               s, in fact, ‘‘necessary to maintain the greater life of the Earth itself,’’ and by extension, ourselves (Pienaar, 2011, p. 27; see also Lifton, 1979).
              
              Lifton (1979) believed that symbolic immortality was essential to psychological well-being as
              a mechanism toward reducing death anxieties. He outlined five possible modes of symbolic
              immortality: the biological, theological, creative, natural, and the special mode of experiential
              transcendence. The fourth and fifth modes relate directly to our affiliation with the natural
              environment and our experiences within it. The natural mode of symbolic immortality is derived
              from our perception that the natural environment around us is ‘‘limitless in space and time’’ and
              will remain long after we have passed on (p. 22). Lifton’s (1979) fifth mode of symbolic immortality—the special mode of experiential transcendence— is one in which a person experiences an ecstatic oneness with the universe, wherein the individual feels alive and connected, resulting in the temporary cessation of a sense of time and death. As discussed previously, nature connectedness and experiences in nature are linked to feelings of transcendence and oneness with the universe. Shneidman (1995) also proposed that an affiliation with nature can assuage death anxieties by creating a concept of the postself that
              will live on through the cosmos itself.
              
              The struggle for existence, the flourishing of life even in harsh conditions, and the cycle of
              life—death—life-born-anew are salient features of the natural environment that provide us with symbols of transcendent immortality that we can identify with and find solace in. Elliot and Maier’s (2012) color in context theory has recently argued that, for humans, the color green (characteristic of much of nature) is inherently associated with life, hope, and growth. Thus, nature affiliation and experiences in nature can act as a means of fostering death acceptance.
              
               The pursuit of ‘the good life’ is through our broadest valuational experience of nature.</p>

              <h3> Nature Affiliation and Happiness </h3>
        <section1> <p>“We do not know an edible root in the woods. We cannot tell our course by the stars, nor the hour of the day by the sun”</p>
        </section1> <section6><p>The end or death of nature (McKibben, 1989; Merchant, 1980) itself is of increasing concern in today’s industrialized, commercialized world, where humankind’s overarching goal seems to be that of control over the natural world. The destruction of many natural areas confronts humanity with another aspect of existential death anxiety that we, and the Earth, are ill-prepared for. Humankind’s current relationship with the larger-than-human world is resulting in a degradation of the well-being of all concerned—human and nonhuman alike (Adams, 2010b; Fischer, 2005; Kidner, 2007; Mason, 2005). An emphasis of freedom of action over responsibility with regard to the natural environment has increased the danger that natural forces present for us (i.e., the increased frequency of high intensity storms caused by human-induced climate change)
Findings in support of Wilson’s biophilia hypothesis have emerged (Kaplan and Kaplan 1989 ; Ulrich 1993 ) , including evidence for human preference for savannah-like landscapes, bene ficial physiological responses to natural environments relative to manufactured environments, and improvements in cognitive functioning and restorative effects on mental well-being as a result of exposure to nature (see review by Joye 2007 ) .
          
          <br>Additional support for Wilson’s ( 1984 ) idea that we have a deep-rooted connection to nature comes from the fact that only recently in our evolutionary history have we separated ourselves from a hunter-gatherer way of life which was immersed daily in nature (Burns 2005 ; Frumkin 2001 ; Gullone 2000 ; Kahn 1997 ; Kellert 1997 ; Nesse and Wiliams 1996 ) . There is dissociation between human biology and modern urban life. As Gelter ( 2000 ) writes “[t]he time-span in our habitat change from the natural world setting into the technological habitat is too short for the evolutionary processes to permit any major biological adaptations” (p. 86). Within this context, affiliating with nature is framed as a basic human need. 
          
          Unfortunately, humanity is increasingly neglecting this instinctual preference or need. In 1847 , Emerson lamented that “[w]e do not know an edible root in the woods. We cannot tell our course by the stars, nor the hour of the day by the sun” In 2013, some 160-odd years later, our disengagement from nature is even more pronounced, widespread, and lamentable. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced in 2009 that more than half of the world’s population now lives in an urban, rather than rural, environment; WHO projects this will increase to 65% by 2030 (WHO, 2011). In Canada, for example, the 50% urbanization mark was passed in 1941, and today, more than 80% of Canadians live in urban areas (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada 2007 ) . <br>On average, Canadians spend almost 90% of their time indoors (Environment Canada 2005 ) , and a Kaiser Family Foundation study ( 2010 ) reported that the average child (aged 8–18) in the United States spends over 7 h a day plugged into some form of entertainment media. Both time-criterion and nature knowledge-criterion studies show that nature-based recreation is on the decline in many countries (Charles and Louv 2009 ; Pergams and Zaradic 2008 ). Terms such as nature deficit disorder (Louv 2005 ) and nature starvation (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds 2010 ) have been coined to reflect our increasing disconnection from nature. In a recent survey of 1,000 United Kingdom citizens, only 55% of those over the age of 35, and 37% of those under the age of 35, reported feeling “connected to the natural world” (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds 2010 ) . But, does this epoch of industrialization really matter? Are we, both individually and as a species, poorer because of this protracted divorce from nature? Evidence is mounting that answers these questions with a resounding “yes.” Nature affiliation and exposure to elements of the natural environment clearly, and significantly, impact our physical health and overall well-being in a positive manner. We need the tonic of wildness. (Thoreau 1854/1989 , p. 339. In the last decade alone, several lines of inquiry have explored the relationship between physical health and engagement with, or proximity to elements of the natural world. For example, Pretty (as cited in Mind 2007 ) found that green exercise —exercising while viewing photographs or pictures of nature—reduced blood pressure to a greater degree than did exercising in the absence of such photos or in the presence of less green rural or urban photos. Takano et al. ( 2002 ) showed that longevity was greater among senior citizens living in areas with walkable green spaces. Five year survival rates for 3,144 Tokyo seniors, born in 1903, 1908, 1913, or 1918, were analyzed. Variables such as age, sex, marital status, socioeconomic status, and baseline physical ability were controlled. Having walkable green streets and spaces near the seniors’ residences showed significant predictive value for elderly survival over the 5 years of the study. It appears that character Carrie Watts (played by actress Geraldine Page), in The Trip to Bountiful, justly proclaimed , “I bet I can live to a hundred if only I can get outdoors again.”  Historical data concerning over 10,000 people in Holland was analyzed by de Vries et al. ( 2003 ) to explore the relationship between green space and health. <br>Respondent information was used only if the degree of urbanism in their neighborhood had remained constant over the time period that the data had been originally collected and if respondents had lived in their current location for over 12 months. These two exclusion criteria left 10,197 respondents from 1,155 different neighborhoods. Three global health indicators were used: number of symptoms experienced in the past 2 weeks, perceived general health rated on a 5-point scale, and the Dutch version of Goldberg’s 1972 Global Health Questionnaire. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables were controlled, as was level of urbanism. A strong relationship between health and greenness of environment was shown; people living in a greener environment, regardless of level of urbanism, reported fewer physical symptoms and greater perceived general health. Of particular note, de Vries et al. found that “assuming a causal relation between greenspace [ sic ] and health, 10% more greenspace [ sic ] in the living environment leads to a decrease in the number of symptoms that is comparable with a decrease in age by 5 years” (p. 7). <br>A subsequent study conducted by Maas et al. ( 2006 ) involved the review of records for 250,782 Dutch citizens being treated by 104 general practitioners; the relationship between health and green space was confirmed. Maas et al. reported that “health differences in residents of urban and rural municipalities are to a large extent explained by the amount of green space” in the individuals’ direct living environment (p. 591).

      <h3> Internet of Things </h3>
          <section1> <p>Our world is more driven by the biophilia hypothesis than in the past,</p></section1>
            <section6><p>Technology has begun to change our species’ long-standing experiences with nature. Even when lacking of biophilic activities, we can still immerse our
              selves in mimic of nature, using technology. It has been widely accepted that with advancement in technology there has been a growing distance between nature an
              d humans. But even then the drive of biophilia is such that there has been the development of the concept of Internet Of Things (IoT):

              IoT refers to the networked interconnection of everyday objects, which are often equipped with ubiquitous intelligence. IoT will increase the ubiquity of the In
              ternet by integrating every object for interaction via embedded systems, which leads to a highly distributed network of devices communicating with human beings 
              as well as other devices. Thanks to rapid advances in underlying technologies, IoT is opening tremendous opportunities for a large number of novel applications t
              hat promise to improve the quality of our lives. In recent years, IoT has gained much attention from researchers and practitioners from around the world. American philosopher Francis Sanzaro put forth the claim our world is more driven by the biophilia hypothesis than in the past, namely, the desire to connect with forms of life. In this case: connect with lifelike nature — technological nature, or IoT in which we use devices that have their computer-generated voice and arise a feeling of being alive when around us. 
              
              The mimic of the real nature— technologies that in various ways mediate, augment, or simulate the natural world. Entire television networks, such as 3D-IMAX movie
              s, virtual nature walks, and nature shows such as the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, provide us with mediated digital experiences of nature: the lion’s hun
              t, the Monarch’s migration, or a climb high into the Himalayan peaks. Video games like Zoo Tycoon engage children with animal life. Zoos themselves are bringing t
              echnologies such as webcams into their exhibits so that we can, for example, watch animals from the leisure of our home or a cafe. Interactive technical-nature experiences are also now possible. For example, real people now spend substantial time in virtual environments (e.g. Second Life); An online tele-garden, developed at the University of Southern California, was active from 1995 to 2005; in its first year alone, over 9,000 people remotely accessed this live garden, planting and cultivating it (see http://www.telegarden.org/tg/ for archival videos). One can even hunt and kill live animals from one’s living room by telehunting, although public outcry has caused some jurisdictions to ban this practice (Associated Press 2007 ). Also, consumer-level robotic pets are now readily available, Inexpensive robot pets have been big sellers in the Wal-Marts and Targets of the world. Sony’s higher-end robot dog AIBO sold well. Anthropologist Richard Nelson (as cited in Kahn 1997 ) described our society as being alienated from nature due to our viewing the natural world from “a great di
              stance of mind” (p. 13). As the rate and spread of industrialization and urbanization increases, this distance is extending from the mental to the physical, tech
              nical-nature experiences are also now possible.</p></section6>

        <section1><p> The division of perception into two realities causes a blurring comparable to intoxication: we are seeing double…To live in one reality and then, from time to time, enter another, through a night of drinking or hallucinogens, is one thing. But to live all the time through telecommunication and the electronic highway is another. I don't think we can even imagine what it may provoke in people's minds and in society to live constantly with this "stereo-reality." It is absolutely without precedent.   
</p></section1> <br>

<section71><p>
  The effect of the immediacy that telecommunications have afforded society has been theorized by Paul Virilio. In his work, he claims that ―the old line of the horizon curls itself inside the frame of the screen. He goes on to say that there is: 
</p><p>“No more delay, no more relief, volume is no longer the
  reality of things. This is now concealed in the flatness of
  figures. Right here and now, life-size is no longer the
  yardstick of the real. The real is hidden in the reduction of
  images on the screen.”
  </p> 
   <P>What Virilio means here is that in the current age of telecommunication, physical space(s) and distance(s) can no longer be conceived as ―the real. In other words, much of contemporary interpersonal connection and communication is achieved through digital technology, which erases any sense of physical space or distance between connected parties by allowing instant access to virtually anywhere on the globe
  </P> 
  <P>Overall within Virilio’s book, “Open Sky”, he discusses the impact of technology on shaping perception and society today. He sees new technologies as substituting a virtual world for the real one. He argues that our advances in technology are destroying our view of the world by creating new objects and spaces. These include objects like cyberspace and virtual reality and new forms of space/time perception such as computer generated realities. These cannot really be explained by modern ideas and instead need new modes of thought. He warns that the dangers of technology are growing out of control and argues that it is weakening human abilities, taking over certain functions, and making humans reliant on it. Therefore, technology becomes a major problem and threat today due to its harmful effects. Virilio thinks technology is taking away direct observation and thus common sense. Due to this, we are also losing our grasp on the materiality and concreteness of objects and people in everyday life. New technological developments disrupt our natural experience and reformat the ways in which we find meaning instead into a virtual realm. Society is then subject to technological control and we must do something about it.
  </P> 
  <P>
    In looking at new information technology, Virilio examines the shift from the transportation revolution to a communication revolution. He says, “the ‘information revolution’ that has today superseded the revolution in industrial manufacturing is not without danger, for the damage done by progress in interactivity may well be as harmful in the future as that done by radioactivity” (118). He claims that these new forms of communication and transportation are taking us ‘out of this world,’ so to speak. In the beginning, he compares technological advances to limits of the sky and horizon in order to make the point that they bring us past the limits of space and time and into a new dimension with its own temporality, spatiality, and ways of being.

nment

The youth of today are not permitted to approach
the traditional heritage of mankind through the door
of technological awareness. This only possible door
for them is slammed in their faces by a rear-viewmirror
society.
The young today live mythically and in depth. But
they encounter instruction in situations organized
by means of classified information—subjects are
unrelated, they are visually conceived in terms of
a blueprint. Many of our institutions suppress all
the natural direct experience of youth, who respond
with untaught delight to the poetry and the beauty
of the new technological environment, the environment
of popular culture. It could be their door to
all past achievement if studied as an active (and
not necessarily benign) force.
The student finds no means of involvement for
himself and cannot discover how the educational
scheme relates to his mythic world of electronically
processed data and experience that his clear and
direct responses report.
It is a matter of the greatest urgency that our educational
institutions realize that we now have civil
war among these environments created by media
other than the printed word. The classroom is now
in a vital struggle for survival with the immensely
persuasive "outside" world created by new informational
media. Education must shift from instruction,
from imposing of stencils, to discovery —to probing
and exploration and to the recognition of the language
of forms.
The young today reject goals. They want roles—
R-O-L-E-S. That is, total involvement. They do not
want fragmented, specialized goals or jobs.
We now experience simultaneously the dropout
and the teach-in. The two forms are correlative.
They belong together. The teach-in represents an
attempt to shift education from instruction to discovery,
from brainwashing students to brainwashing
instructors. It is a big, dramatic reversal. Vietnam,
as the content of the teach-in, is a very small
and perhaps misleading Red Herring. It really has
little to do with the teach-in, as such, anymore than
with the dropout.
The dropout represents a rejection of nineteenth century
technology as manifested in our educational
establishments. The teach-in represents a
creative effort, switching the educational process
from package to discovery. As the audience becomes
a participant in the total electric drama,
the classroom can become a scene in which the
audience performs an enormous amount of work

The ear favors no particular "point of view." We 
are enveloped by sound. It forms a seamless web 
around us. We say, "Music shall fill the air." We 
never say, "Music shall fill a particular segment 
of the air." 

We hear sounds from everywhere, without ever 
having to focus. Sounds come from "above," from 
"below," from in "front" of us, from "behind" us, 
from our "right," from our "left." We can't shut out 
sound automatically. We simply are not equipped 
with earlids. Where a visual space is an organized 
continuum of a uniformed connected kind, the ear 
world is a world of simultaneous relationships.

  <h3>Out of Our Depth</h3> 
  <section1><p>Introducing the three dimensions: the illusion of physical depth and the hyper-extensional generation
  </p></section1>
<section71> <p>Along with 3-D, larger screens (such as IMAX) also fall into the paradoxical category of technology that is hyped as being more immersive, while calling attention to itself as being more spectacular—in fact, it is precisely these screens that cause Zone to name his third period ―The Immersive Era. 

In a way, three-dimensional media may have a similar function to medication for
forcing deep-attention from someone who may generally be more hyper-attentive. Three-dimensional media is commonly hyped as being immersive, something that strives for deep attention. As noted in my introduction, this concept has been compared to one of Siegfried Kracauer‘s theories, the ―mass ornament, where in Kracauer analyzes the Tiller Girls, a synchronized dancing troupe in Berlin during the 1920s. Again, the gist of his argument in this article is that the ―mass ornament (the Tiller Girls) is the ―aesthetic reflex of the rationality to which the prevailing economic system aspires.Its structure ―reflects that of the entire contemporary situation. One way it does so is through its synched, mechanical movements, which mimic those of the assembly line. In this way, workers are basically shown their social reality through their aesthetic entertainment.

In this way, there clearly seems to be a link between the aesthetic of or desire for immersion in contemporary films and neoliberalism which ―involves an incorporative mode of subjectivity. In other words, the contemporary social reality of being ―immersed in one‘s work is therefore reflected in the aesthetics of one‘s entertainment. Three-dimensionality only helps satiate this desire for immersion, in that it creates the illusion of depth and substance in flat digital imagery, and requires a level of deep
attention to perceive the illusion. Of course, whether or not deep attention is actually
more ―immersive‖ than hyper attention is also arguable. Deep attention does not
necessarily provide a more ―immersive‖ experience, it just involves focusing on only one object or task. In this way, hyper attention can be said to be more ―immersive, because a hyper-attentive state involves dealing with a collection of tasks, focusing on many things at once.

Three-dimensional media most commonly functions to alleviate this social crisis by creating digital spaces that resemble what has been lost in peoples‘ day-to-day lives due to hyper-extensionality—i.e., depth and substance. 3-D also requires focused attention, which heightens the illusion of the spectator being ―immersed in its ―depth. By ―immersed in its depth, I mean the sense of being deeply engaged or involved in the media upon which one‘s attention is focused to the extent that one feels absorbed or ―sucked into‖ it. In the case of three-dimensional media this sensation can be figurative, as previously described, but it is also literal, in that the three-dimensionality can make digital media appear to physically inhabit the same space as the spectator, essentially immersing the spectator in its imagery.

Due to advances in digital media and, by extension, modes of communication— that the debate over attention and distraction in children has grown in prominence over the last couple decades. The assumption that attention itself is a static, definite concept is one that should be avoided, and Katherine Hayles does so in her work by abstaining from the use of the term ―distraction‖ as attention‘s antithesis. Instead, she discusses two different cognitive modes: hyper and deep attention. Deep attentio refers to rigorous concentration on a single object for a length of time, while hyper attention is the opposite; it is the mode that is required for what is commonly called ―multi-tasking, and therefore, it is also the mode that coincides with hyper-extension

hyper-extensionality is the contemporary state of being shared by millions of people
who are technologically over-extended in multiple ways—in sheer quantity of
connections as well as in frequency and duration of said connections. ―Extension here is used in terms of Marshall McLuhan‘s concept of media as ―extensions of ourselves, a claim that all media introduce a ―new scales into human affairs—that is, any new media extends people (physically and mentally), allowing them to perform in ways that are not possible without said media and fundamentally reforming the way society functions as a result.1 While McLuhan saw great social potential in the extension of our nervous systems through electronic media, today many people are hyper-extended on a regular basis. They are simultaneously, or synchronously, extended in myriad ways through two dimensional digital media—from newer portable devices such as ―smartphones and ―tablets to more traditional electronic devices such as television and computers. Such is the case because success in contemporary capitalist society requires one to be ―plugged in at all times, always connected to the network, and infinitely flexible.

There are two primary modes of attention, deep and hyper, which, according to
Hayles, can be used to explain the divide created by Generation M‘s media-saturated
environment and consequent difference in brain function, and the developmental
environment experienced by older generations. Deep attention is characterized by
―concentrating on a single object for long periods, ignoring outside stimuli while so
engaged, preferring a single information stream, and having a high tolerance for long
focus times.Hyper attention, conversely, consists of ―switching focus rapidly among different tasks, preferring multiple information streams, seeking a high level of
stimulation, and having a low tolerance for boredom. What is interesting is that hyper
attention is simultaneously associated with multitasking (or what I have referred to as
hyper-extensionality) as well as distraction. Yet these two terms tend to connote
opposing opinions of the same behavior—that is, the ability to multitask is considered to
be a positive tool for efficiency and success in contemporary society, while distraction is
typically considered to be negative, and wasteful.

In education especially, hyper attention has been branded as ―defective behavior‖ because much of the curriculum still relies on deep attention. The label this ―defective behavior‖ has taken on is widely known in contemporary society as it has seemingly become an epidemic. The label, of course, is ―ADHD‖ (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), a disorder that first appeared in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or DSM-III) in 1980. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) states that recent survey data indicates ― approximately 9.5%, or 5.4 million children 4-17 years of age have been diagnosed with ADHD, as of 2007,‖ and ―the percentage of children with a parent-reported ADHD diagnosis increased by 22% between 2003 and 2007. However, if brain plasticity is causing this shift towards hyper attention on a generational level due to media saturation and contemporary hyper-extensionality, what is the most socially just way to deal with this issue?

One of Hayles‘ main arguments is that the brains of younger generations who
have grown up entirely in the ―digital age have developed differently than those of
previous generations, and therefore education needs to be reformed in order to properly
deal with hyper-attentive youth. What is important here is that Hayles‘ argument relies
on the theory that our environment (and therefore our media) configures the way our
brains function through a process called synaptogenesis (which is a staple of
contemporary neuroscience). The concept that our media molds our brains factors
heavily into my argument that the cultural saturation of two-dimensional digital media,
through which much of contemporary life is conducted, has produced a lack of spatiality,
and a desire for depth. As the brains of young generations are developing more and more for hyper attention, they are also being primed more and more for hyper-extension. Such catering to hyper attention, and hyper-extension, only conforms future generations to the current neoliberal system

  <h2><em>FULL MEASURE OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND OF HUMAN FLOURISHING? </em></h2>
        <h3>The Evolution of Happiness</h3>
        <section1>
          <p> Appreciating the beauty of a blossom, the loveliness of a lilac, or the grace of a gazelle are all ways in which people can, in some small measure, fill their daily lives with evolutionarily inspired epiphanies of pleasure.</p> </section1> <br>
        <section8>
          <p>
            Studies of private wishes reveal an evolutionary menu of motivations designed to achieve goals historically correlated with fitness. These include the desire for health, professional success, helping friends and relatives, achieving intimacy, feeling the confidence to succeed, satisfying the taste tot high-quality food, securing personal safety, and having the resources to attain all these things (King & Broyles, I997; Petrie, White, Cameron, & Collins, in press). Success at satisfying these desires brings episodes of deep happiness, even if people might habituate to their constant occurrence.

The fulfillment of mating desires provides another path. One of the most consistent findings in studies of well-being is the link to marriage (Diener et al., 1999). Married women and men are significantly happier than single women and men, even when other variables such as age and income are statistically controlled. Moreover, among married people, those who have succeeded in fulfilling their desire for a spouse who embodies the personality characteristics of agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience tend to be more emotionally and sexually satisfied with their marriages than those who fail to marry spouses with these qualities (Botwin, Buss, & Shackelford, 1997).

As a species, humans have conquered many of the external hostile forces of nature that formerly threatened bodily survival. They have created environments that are relatively friction free; they have reduced infant mortality, polio, and malaria; conquered food shortages through agriculture; reduced the destructive impact of extremes of temperature and climate; and eliminated most predators. Evolution has equipped people with a host of mechanisms designed to allow people to bathe themselves in aesthetic pleasure. People can design environments to exploit evolved affec­tive mechanisms that signal adaptive affordances. Land­ scape preferences provide a perfect illustration (Kaplan, 1992; Orians & Heerwagen, 1992). Research supports the hypothesis that humans have evolved specific habitat pref­erences that mimic certain aspects of the ancestral savanna terrain.

            In addition to fulfilling major desires, evolution has equipped people with a host of mechanisms designed to allow people to bathe themselves in aesthetic pleasure. People can design environments to exploit evolved affective mechanisms that signal adaptive affordances. Landscape preferences provide a perfect illustration (Kaplan, 1992; Orians & Heerwagen, 1992). Research supports the hypothesis that humans have evolved specific habitat preferences that mimic certain aspects of the ancestral savanna terrain.People like natural over human-made environ­ments, habitats with running water and terrain to house game. They like places where they can see without being seen (a "womb with a view"). They like environments that provide resources and safety, prospect and refuge, lush vegetation and fresh fruit. As noted by Orians and Heer wagen, "It may be difficult for many of us, with the year-round supplies of a wide array of fruits and vegetables in our supermarkets, to understand the importance of the first salad greens of the season to people throughout most of human history" (1992, p. 569). Appreciating the beauty of a blossom, the loveliness of a lilac, or the grace of a gazelle are all ways in which people can, in some small measure, fill their daily lives with evolutionarily inspired epiphanies of pleasure.

        <h3>Tale(s) of a Forest</h3>  
              <section1><p>Finland documentary film Re-Create the Primeval Forest, calls for restoring relationship with forest </p> </section1><br> 
              <section8>
                <p> The documentary film— Metsän tarina / Tale of a Forest , Finland, 2012 (the book with the same name, 2013) is one of the first examples of the current wave of such cultural products. Tale of a Forest is the result of a collaboration between nature photographers and filmmakers and is one of the most popular documentary films ever produced in Finland. In 2013, it was adapted into a “coffee table book” with the same title. Both versions tell a mythic story of the Finnish forest and its origins. The filmmakers were worried about the disappearance of old forests in Finland. By showing a beautiful, harmonious forest that has hardly been touched by humans, they wanted people to see the value of Finnish nature and help them restore their relationship to it.
              </p>
            <p>
              It is a common claim that Finnish people have a special relationship with the forest. According
              to recent research, 83% of Finns consider forests important or very important ( Kantar TNS 2018; Halla et al. 2018). This is not surprising because Finns spend a lot of their free time in forests that are accessible through ‘everyman’s rights’.This relationship with the forest was even included in the UNESCO Finnish National Inventory of Intangible Living Heritage in 2017.
              
              The forest is an integral part of the Finnish national culture and identity that lives in numerous
              cultural products, stories, and myths. For example, in the national epic myth Kalevala, the founding of the entire nation is pinned to the depths of wild forests. Simultaneously through the ages, forests have also provided a variety of raw materials, food and shelter, and have enabled livelihoods in agriculture and forestry. This diverse utilization of forests has led to intensive management of a resource that makes up 75% of Finland’s land area, with only 12% of the productive forest land under protection. For decades, this has meant alteration of natural forest dynamics with ﬁre suppression, monoculture cultivation, selective thinning and ﬁnal harvesting with clear-cutting.
              
            </p>
          <p>
            These practices have led to habitat destruction and threats to many species (Kouki et al. 2001; Kuuluvainen 2009; Hyvärinen et al. 2019). Changes to practice have been slow, as forest harvesting methods other than clear-cutting were only allowed for the ﬁrst time in 2014 when the Finnish Forest Act was amended. Furthermore, the protected forests do not distribute evenly within the country. For instance, only 5% of the forest is protected in southern Finland where the most productive forests are situated (Vaahtera et al. 2018). Recently, the assertion that Finns have a close relationship with the forest has been challenged. This relationship can be criticised for being a romanticizing, contradictory and even exclusive myth. Rather, the intensiﬁed industrial use of forests during the 20th century is a cause of deep, ongoing disputes and conﬂicts (Siiskonen 2007). Therefore, it could be argued that the forest relationship has not been harmonious, but is instead based on exploitation ( Jokiranta et al. 2019a). Our knowledge of the forest is not only created by experiencing real physical forest environments, but also through cultural representations. Nature documentaries, for example, play a signiﬁcant role in creating the visual and narrative conventions of how we see and understand the natural world ( Willoquet-Maricondi 2010, pp. 7–8; Bousé 2000, p. 192). In recent years, an increasing numberof cultural products that deal with Finns’ relationship to the forest have been produced, such asnon-ﬁction books, ﬁlms and exhibitions.

          </p>
        <p>
          The voice-over in the film and the text of the book introduce an anthropocentric viewpoint that recalls old folk beliefs. An adult and child, father and son, alternate as narrators, but no human beings are shown. The man’s narrative focuses on the myths and beliefs about the forest and its meaning for people. He describes the habits of the portrayed species and explains how traditional folk beliefs relate to natural phenomena, thus adding layers of cultural meanings to the visual representation. The boy’s narration focuses on the teachings of his father and his own experiences and imaginations, such as “I imagined I was in the old forest during the Carboniferous period. (. . .) What kind of animals would have run there? (. . .) A slithering slow worm?”
          Close to the end of the film, the adult narrator points out that the fate of humans was believed to be connected to the fate of the tree of life. People were afraid that if the tree fell, they too would be destroyed. The tree of life appears in mythologies across the world as well as in modern stories such as the film Avatar (2009, USA), in which the destruction of the home tree is a disaster for the imaginary Na’vi people.
          After the publication of Metsän tarina, the discussion around the state of forests has become more intense in Finland. There have been many books, films, articles and campaigns about forests and their connection with climate change and the biodiversity crisis. One of them is the award-winning book, The Forest After Us. It challenges myths and reveals the reality of the state of the Finnish forests. Outside of protected areas, the forests are not what we might imagine. The majority of them are young and fragmented with clear-cut areas. The authors point out that most Finnish people have never actually been to an old forest in its natural state. In fact, the authors have received recurrent feedback from readers that the book helped them realize the difference between a primeval and a managed forest for the first time.
          Because the majority of Finnish forests are managed, most Finnish people have never set foot in an old forest in its natural state. In a way, we have lost the knowledge of what a real natural forest looks like. This phenomenon has been described as “shifting baseline syndrome”or “environmental generational amnesia”. It takes place when each new generation perceives the environmental conditions in which they grew up as “normal”. We discuss how environmental generational amnesia motivates the creators of the scrutinized works and potentially has an effect on the reception of these works as environmental narratives.
          Tale of a Forest is the first entry in a trilogy of standalone films that combine nature footage and Finnish mythology. Also produced by MRP Matila Röhr Productions, the other entries are Tale of a Lake (2016), which portrays Finland's lakes and their wildlife, and Tale of the Sleeping Giants (2021), which was filmed in the mountains of Sápmi.

          <h3>Environmental Generational Amensia</h3>  
              <section1><p>Does it matter for the physical and psychological well-being of the human species that actual nature is being replaced with technological nature? As 
                the basis for our provisional answer (it is ‘’yes’’)</p>
              </section1><br> 
              <section8><p>In the Journal of Association for Psychological Science. Vol 18, no.1, 2009, Peter H. Kahn, Jr. Rachel L. Severson, Jolina H. Ruckert, together
                 published the article ”The Human Relation With Nature and Technological Nature”. They draw on evolutionary and cross-cultural developmental accounts of the human 
                 relation with nature and some recent psychological research on the effects of technological nature. Finally, we discuss the issue—‘‘environmental generational 
                 amnesia.’’
                First of all, Kahn (1999) and his colleagues conducted a series of cross-cultural studies on children’s environmental reasoning and values. Populations included, for example, African American children (ages 7, 9, and 11) in the inner city of Houston, Texas (Kahn&Friedman, 1995); Brazilian children (age 14) in an urban setting and in a remote location in the Amazon rainforest (Howe, Kahn, & Friedman, 1996); and Portuguese children and adolescents (ages 10, 13, 16, and 19) in Lisbon (Kahn & Lourenc¸o, 2002). The methods were aligned with structural-developmental theory (Turiel, 1983)
    which posits that children’s conceptual knowledge undergoes qualitative changes in development through interaction with the physical and social world. Children were interviewed individually, with structured questions focused on such topics as water pollution, air pollution, parks and open spaces, plants, forests, individual animals, species, and living in harmony with nature. For example, one representative question (of 42 total questions) in Kahn and Lourenc¸o (2002) was: ‘‘Let’s say that in Lisbon everyone throws their garbage in the river, would that be all right or not all right?’’ (p. 410). Across studies, results showed that animals, plants, and parks and open spaces played an important role in children’s lives.
                Children were aware that water pollution can harm birds, water, insects, and landscape aesthetics. Moreover, it mattered to children that harm might occur to each of these environmental constituents. Based on measures that controlled for magnitude of environmental harm and proximity to harm, children also believed that polluting a waterway violates a moral obligation. Other results across the above studies showed two overarching forms of children’s environmental reasoning: anthropocentric and biocentric. Anthropocentric reasoning concerns the ways that affecting the environment affects human beings—including appeals t
                o personal predilections, aesthetics, justice, and physical, material, and psychological welfare considerations. Biocentric reasoning, while allowing for human interests, fundamentally concerns 
                the moral standing of nature—including appeals to the intrinsic value of nature and justice for its constituents (e.g., animal rights). Quantitatively, across studies 
                (and across cultures), anthropocentric reasoning was the predominant form of children’s reasoning, with only about 4% of the children offering biocentric reasons. Thus 
                one important finding from this body of research is that children in diverse cultures— and even in harsh urban landscapes—have meaningful and moral relations with nature 
                in at least some respects.</p>
                <p>Recall that Wilson defined biophilia as the human affiliation with life and lifelike processes. Kahn and colleagues questioned:  But might interacting with tech nature provide 
                  humans the same psychological experience and benefits as actual nature? To further address the question, another study (Kahn et al., 2008) in which 90 participants (30 per group) in an office setting were exposed either to (a) a glass window that afforded a view of a nature scene, (b) a plasma window that afforded a real-time HDTV view of essentially the same scene (Fig. 1b), or (c) a blank wall. As shown in Table 1, they found that, in terms of heart-rate recovery from low-level stress, the glass window was more restorative than a blank wall, but a plasma window was no more restorative than a blank wall. Moreover, when participants in the glass-window condition actually looked out the glass window, their heart rate tended to decrease more rapidly than when they were not looking out the glass window. (In the plasma-window condition, there was no difference in heart-rate recovery when participants looked at the plasma window vs. when they looked elsewhere.)</p><p>Taking both studies together, the plasma nature window appears better than no nature but not as good as actual nature. To find supporting evidence of this pattern in our other five studies across two other forms of technological nature: an advanced robotic dog (AIBO) and a Tele-garden—an actual garden in Austria that allowed remote ‘‘gardeners’’ to plant and tend seeds by controlling a robotic arm through aWeb-based interface (see Table 1). For example, in Melson et al. (in press) children and adolescents more often affirmed that a live dog, in comparison to AIBO, had mental states (83.6% live dog, 56.2% AIBO), could be a companion (91.4% live dog, 70.0% AIBO), and had moral standing (86.3% live dog, 75.7% AIBO). What is particularly interesting in not just that AIBO was not as compelling as a live dog, but that AIBO was as compelling as it was. AIBO also appears somewhat compelling as a social other to adults. As highlighted in Table 1, 60% of anonymous (presumably adult) AIBO owners spontaneously affirmed in their postings in AIBO online discussion forums the social standing of AIBO. For example, one AIBO owner wrote:
</p>
<p><em>Oh yeah I love Spaz [the name for this member’s AIBO], I tell him
  that all the time. . . . When I first bought him I was fascinated by the
  technology. Since then I feel I care about him as a pal, not as a cool
  piece of technology. I do view him as a companion, among other
  things he always makes me feel better when things aren’t so great. I
  dunno about how strong my emotional attachment to him is. . . . I
  find it’s strong enough that I consider him to be part of my family,
  that he’s not just a ‘toy,’ he’s more of a person to me.</em>
  </p><p>And there may be inherent negative consequences to increasingly replacing exposure to the live, natural world with technologically mediated experiences. Winston Churchill admonished that “nature will not be admired by proxy,” and Kahn et al. ( 2008 ) caution that “it is important to address the issue of whether such adaptations are not just different but impoverished from the standpoint of human functioning and flourishing, and whether such technological systems and resulting interactions are shifting the very baseline of what we can recognize as impoverishment” (p. 198).


    We cannot stop the progression of urbanization or technological innovation, nor should we necessarily want to impede them. For example, Valtchanov et al. ( 2010 ; see also Valtchanov and Ellard 2010 ) suggest that computer-generated virtual-reality nature may assist researchers in developing methods and environments with possible therapeutic applications in scenarios where access to real nature is limited. And many of the advances in technology and urban living over the last hundred years have increased our lifespan (e.g., advanced medical diagnostics), improved communication (e.g., telephones and email), and improved the quality of life for many individuals (e.g., teleworking from home). However, “quality of life isn’t measured only by what we gain, but also by what we trade it for” (Louv 2005 , p. 59). We need to recognize the limitations of technology, as Kahn et al.’s ( 2008 ) and others’ research demonstrates. We need, as Canadian wildlife artist and environmentalist Robert Bateman ( 2000 ) wrote, “a new de fi nition of Progress, one that is more elegant and sophisticated, one that values our heritage, both natural and human”
    </p><p>Let us imagine that, as more research emerges on the topic of technological nature, the general trend we have found so far holds up: namely, that interacting with technological nature provides some but not all of the enjoyments and benefits of interacting with actual nature. Interacting with technological nature improves human life at the first glance: when actual nature is not available, substitute technological nature. But such substitutions contribute to an insidious problem. 

      In the study of African American children’s environmental views and values in Houston, Texas (Kahn&Friedman, 1995): The results showed that a significant number of the children understood the idea of air pollution; but they did not believe that Houston had such a problem even though Houston was then (and still remains) one of the most polluted cities in the United States. In interpreting these results, Kahn and Friedman suggested that these children may have lacked a comparative experiential baseline from areas with less pollution by which to recognize that Houston was itself polluted. Granted, it is not possible to exclude the counter-explanation that the children had simply not yet learned about their local pollution. 
      
      Nonetheless, the comparative-baseline interpretation is consistent with the phenomenon of the ‘‘shifting baseline’’ as described by other researchers. Pauly (1995), for example, has written about what he calls the ‘‘shifting baseline syndrome’’ of fisheries:
      </p> <p><em>Essentially, this syndrome has arisen because each generation of
        fisheries scientists accepts as a baseline the stock size and species
        composition that occurred at the beginning of their careers, and
        uses this to evaluate changes. When the next generation starts its
        career, the stocks have further declined, but it is the stocks at that
        time that serve as a new baseline. The result obviously is a gradual
        shift of the baseline, a gradual accommodation of the creeping
        disappearance of resource species. . . . (p. 430)
        
        </em></p><p>Along similar lines, Evans, Jacobs, and Frager (1982) found that long-term residents of Los Angeles judged the smog problem in their city as less detrimental to their health than recent arrivals did. Dubos (1965/1980), too, has shown that any ‘’disease, or any kind of deficiency, that is very widespread in a given social group comes to be considered as the ‘normal’ state and consequently is accepted as a matter of course within that group’’ (pp. 250–251).

          Thus, it is possible—and, in this study view, likely—that, across generations, people experience psychologically something quite similar to the African American children in Houston: that members of each generation construct their conception of what is environmentally normal based on the natural world they encountered in childhood. The crux is that, with each ensuing generation, the amount of environmental degradation can increase, but each generation tends to take that degraded condition as the non-degraded condition—that is, as the normal experience—a condition that Kahn (1999, 2002) has termed environmental generational amnesia.
          </p> <p>That, in a nutshell, is the potential problem with technological nature: while we adapting gradually to the degradation of actual nature, we will also be drawn to increasingly sophisticated and pervasive forms of technological nature, which will provide some but not all of the benefits of actual nature.  

            We are not born tabula rasa ; we are a product of our evolutionary past and carry the seeds of many innate tendencies—including biophilia. We must not, for the benefit of ourselves as individuals and as a species, allow these biophilic seeds to lie fallow within us. Rather, we must nourish and cultivate this tendency in order to become complete and flourishing. Because of biophilia, because our evolutionary need to affiliate with nature—we will suffer physical and psychological costs.
            </p> <p>In turn, there will be a downward shift (as there has been already) in the baseline across generations for what counts as a full measure of the human experience and of human flourishing. This shift makes and will continue to make societal change difficult. For example, if you try to explain to a person what we, as humans, are missing in terms of the fullness of the human relation with nature, a well-meaning person can look at you blankly and respond ‘‘but I don’t think we’re missing anything.’’ It is hard enough to address environmental problems, such as global climate change, when people are aware of them; it is all the harder when they are not. Thus, the problem of environmental generational amnesia may emerge as one of the central psychological problems of our lifetime.
